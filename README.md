##Game intro
You embarked on an adventure with a group of explorers to find a treasure that is hidden in a cave. After walking cautiously for a while, you have reached a very dangerous spot deep inside the cave. The members of your group are abandoning the place because they do not want to take the risk. But you still have a chance. Do you think you can get the treasure? Do you dare to continue?
